# Database-Management-Final-Project
#### A leave management system designed for employees to apply for leave and look up the leave record. Also, for employers to approve those leave.

ðŸ“ƒThe system consists of 7 classes:

Each class contains a page with their own function. 
  <br>All the employees can log in the system by entering thier ID and password.
  <br>After logging into the system, the user have three options to choose-- <strong>Leave Application</strong>, <strong>Leave Record</strong>, and <strong>Leave Approval</strong>.
  <br>âž¤ If you choose to enter the <strong>Leave Application</strong> page, you can fill out the leave application form to take a leave.
  <br>âž¤ If you choose to enter the <strong>Leave Record</strong> page, you can look up your own leave record and their approval status.
  <br>âž¤ If you are not the junior staff, you can choose to enter the <strong>Leave Approval</strong> page, where you can view whether there is any your subordinate applying for leave.
